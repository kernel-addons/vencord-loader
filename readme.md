# Vencord Loader

Loads [Vencord](https://vencord.dev) inside kernel.

# Getting Started

Make sure to define the `"VENCORD_DIST": "path/to/vencord"` path in the `index.json` file so we can load your Vencord local clone that is already built. If you don't have it installed already, you can also clone it inside here and follow their local development guide. In the end, we need vencord to be built properly and be able to run it's files from the dist folder.
